Welcome to my forked version of google VIM plug-in [vim-codefmt](https://github.com/google/vim-codefmt)

Hopefully this isn't a long-term fork, so please see the original [README.MD](https://github.com/google/vim-codefmt/blob/master/README.md) for usage information.

The differences at the moment are:-
* It includes XML formatting support via xmlllint [per Rupert's pending pull request](https://github.com/google/vim-codefmt/pull/93)
* THe prettier.io formatter has been configured to allow JSON formatting
